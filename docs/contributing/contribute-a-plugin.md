# Contribute a Plugin

Pipcook welcomes developers to contribute plugins for us to extend the functions of Pipcook. This document describes how to develop a plugin. The content involved in this article is just a few suggestions, the specific plugin can run successfully in Pipcook as long as it meets our plugin prototype specifications.

We strongly recommend that you first understand the [plugin specification](../spec/plugin.md) that we define. Only plugins that meet the interface that we define can be accepted.

## Get Started

To get started with developing a new plugin, [Pipcook Tools][] provides `pipcook plugin-dev`:

```sh
$ pipcook plugin-dev --type <category> --name <plugin>
```

A plugin script is a TypeScript function that inherits from the corresponding plugin interface, for exmaple, a `DataCollectType` plugin will look like this:

```js
const collectTextline: DataCollectType = async (args: ArgsType): Promise<void> => {
  const { uri, dataDir } = args;
  await fs.copy(uri, dataDir + '/my-own-dataset.csv');
  return null;
};
```

For other plugin interfaces, see [this list of plugin categories](../spec/plugin.md#plugin-category).


## Plugin development

If the `DataProcessType` plugin needs to double the size of each feature, you can implement your plugin as follows:

```js
const doubleSize: DataProcessType = async (sample: Sample, metadata: Metadata, args?: ArgsType): Promise<void> => {
  // double the data
  sample.data = sample.data * 2;
};
export default doubleSize;
```

You need to check the following two before releasing that:

- a plugin is able to run without any errors.
- the returned value of your plugin comply with the [plugin specfication](../spec/plugin.md).

After ensuring the preceding the above, you can run a real pipeline to check whether your plugin is compatible with the corresponding upstream and downstream plugins.

### Developing with Python

In order to allow some non-Node.js developers (such as algorithm engineers) to contribute plugins to Pipcook, we provide a plugin development environment based entirely on Python. The script is as follows:

```py
# __init__.py
def main(sample, metadata, args):
  sample.data *= 2
```

Pipcook agrees that the `main` function is used as the entrance of the plugin. The parameters are consistent with those of the Node.js plugin. The file also needs to be named `__init__.py`. In addition, you need to add in package.json:

```json
{
  "pipcook": {
    "runtime": "python"
  }
}
```

In this way, when Pipcook loads the plugin, it will use the Python loader to load. If you need to use a third-party library of Python, you can also declare under `conda.dependencies` as follows:

```json
{
  "pipcook": {
    "runtime": "python"
  },
  "conda": {
    "dependencies": {
      "tensorflow": "*",
      "numpy": "*"
    }
  }
}
```

## Release

Once you have developed the plugin done, you can create own plugin package on NPM:

```sh
$ npm publish
```

And anyone could try your plugin via the following command:

```sh
$ pipcook plugin install your-pipcook-plugin-name
```
