# Want to use python?

The purpose of pipcook is to serve front-end engineers and promote the development of front-end intelligence. Therefore, pipcook is developed using JavaScript (TypeScript), giving developers JS-based APIs and running in all pipelines in the JS environment. However, at the current stage in the fields of mathematics, data analysis, data processing, and machine learning, the ecology of python is more prosperous. Therefore, we developed pipcook-python-node, hoping to introduce the entire python ecology into pipcook, and call the python class library in JS way, thereby expanding the capabilities of JS.

### Runtime

---

python >= 3.6, you can run the command below to get python version

```
python --version
```

to get pip version

```
pip --version
```

In fact, when you use the pipcook-python-node api, we will automatically create a virtual environment in the current working directory, but in order to ensure the environment configuration is correct, you can also manually create a python virtual environment, you can run the following command in the current working directory

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --no-site-packages pipcook_venv
```

**We strongly recommend that you use our docker image to run pipcook, so that you no longer need to execute the above commands, and you don't need to worry about the environment, you can refer to the detailed docker information **[**here**](https://alibaba.github.io/pipcook/doc/Low-level-plugin-style%20Quick%20Start-en)<br />**
```
docker pull pipcook/pipcook:version-0.4

```

### An example

---

Here let us show you an example how you can use pipcook-python-node to take advantage of the python ecosystem. This example is about a deep learning training, showing how we use Keras (a well-known tensorflow-based python high-level deep learning framework) for deep convolutional network training in js. For better illustration, we will compare Do the same with python and js

<a name="4MzuV"></a>
#### python
```python
import numpy as np
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
from keras.optimizers import SGD

# Generate dummy data
x_train = np.random.random((100, 100, 100, 3))
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(np.random.randint(10, size=(100, 1)), num_classes=10)

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 100, 3)))

model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

sgd = SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
```

<a name="to2iW"></a>
#### pipcook-python-node (JS)

```python
Python.scope('test1', (python) => {
    const _ = python.nA;
    python.install('numpy');
    python.install('keras');
    python.install('tensorflow');
    const np = python.import('numpy');
    const keras = python.import('keras');
    const [Sequential] = python.fromImport('keras.models', ['Sequential']);
    const [Dense, Dropout, Flatten] = python.fromImport('keras.layers', ['Dense', 'Dropout', 'Flatten']);
    const [Conv2D, MaxPooling2D] = python.fromImport('keras.layers', ['Conv2D', 'MaxPooling2D']);
    const [SGD] = python.fromImport('keras.optimizers', ['SGD']);

    const x_train = np.random.random([100, 100, 100, 3]);
    const y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(np.random.randint(10, _({size: [100, 1]})), _({num_classes: 10}));

    const model = Sequential();

    model.add(Conv2D(32, [3, 3], _({activation: 'relu', input_shape: [100, 100, 3]})));

    model.add(Flatten());
    model.add(Dense(256, _({activation: 'relu'})));
    model.add(Dense(10, _({activation: 'softmax'})));

    const sgd = SGD(_({
      lr: 0.01,
      decay: 1e-6,
      momentum: 0.9,
      nesterov: true
    }));

    model.compile(_({
      loss: 'categorical_crossentropy',
      optimizer:sgd
    }));

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, _({batch_size: 32, epochs: 1}));
  });
```

From the comparison of the above two pieces of code, we can see that we try to make the most of the pipcook-python-node API as python as possible. Due to the differences between the two languages, the above two pieces of code are different as follows：

- Because Python supports named arguments for functions and JS does not, so we use `python.nA`  instead. NA stands for named argument. As in the above code, we assign `python.nA`  to `_` , so we can use `model.add(Dense(256, _({activation: 'relu'))))`  instead of `model.add(Dense (256, activation='relu'))`
- pipcook will use the pipcook_venv python virtual environment of the workspace. If it is detected that the current workspace does not have this virtual environment, we will create one. You can use our API: python.install to install the python library, or you can manually enter this virtual environment to install For more information about the python virtual environment, you can refer [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- We provide API: python.import instead of the native import keyword
- We will introduce more pipcook-python-node APIs later

### API Introduction

---


<a name="U1uJE"></a>
#### Python.scope (scopeName: string, callback: Function)

- scopeName: scope is used to identify a python workspace. Each scope has its own independent execution environment. In pipcook-python-node, multiple workspaces can be defined simultaneously, corresponding to multiple ipython kernels.
- callback: This callback function will pass an instance of the Python class to the user. This instance is bound to a workspace that can perform the corresponding operations and python code
- Return: Promise <void>

This function is a static method of the Python class. It returns a python instance for the user. After that, you can use various methods of the python instance to execute python commands.
