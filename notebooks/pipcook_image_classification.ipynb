        "\n",
        "Taking code generation as an example, suppose we have a sketch design draft and the entire design draft is composed of different components. We can traverse the layers of the entire design draft. For each layer, use the model of image classification to identify what component each layer is. After that, we can replace the original design draft layer with the front-end component to generate the front-end code.\n",
