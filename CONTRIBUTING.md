# How to Contribute

## Reporting Issues
- We use Github issues to manage our issues. We use status to mark the progress of our issues.

- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been asked, answered or even fixed in the development branch.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Pipcook. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. If the issues are asked to provide clear descriptions for more than 5 days, we will close it immediately.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, don’t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Only code that's ready for release should be committed to the main branch. All development should be done in dedicated branches.
- Checkout a **new** topic branch from main branch, and merge back against main branch.
