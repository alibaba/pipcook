# How to Contribute
We are excited that you are interested in contributing to Pipcook. Before submitting your contribution, please take a moment to read through a few small guidelines here

## Reporting Issues
- We use Github issues to manage our issues. We use status to mark the progress of our issues.

- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been asked, answered or even fixed in the development branch.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Pipcook. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. If the issues are asked to provide clear descriptions for more than 5 days, we will close it immediately.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Only code that's ready for release should be committed to the master branch. All development should be done in dedicated branches.
- Checkout a **new** topic branch from master branch, and merge back against master branch.
- If adding new feature:
  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your title for a better release log, 
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
